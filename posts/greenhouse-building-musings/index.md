Our reasons for building are some of the usual ones:
- extend the growing season (given that we keep harvesting Tomatoes in mid November not sure that is going to be valid reason for long)
- start the growing season earlier (still applies)
- protect the plants, grow some more exotic ones

And some less so:
- restart our aquaponics projects
- experiment


## key aspects

- should require NO additional heating (not electric or coal/ oil based)
- should be low maintenance
- should be 'automated by natural processes' as much as possible: ie , use things such as
  * thermal expansion/contraction
  * gravity
  * etc
  * in general, do not fight the universe, let it work for you

### No additional heating

I have spent a lot of time in the past few months digging into this and two main solutions are
- passive solar greenhouse 
  * optimised glass (etc) panes to the 'south' (adapt the tilt of the panes to your lattitude !)
  * walls & insulation to the north and east/west
  * be carefull with thermal bridges
  * be very carefull with heat loss through the glass panes: see use of reflective/insulated materials at night
  to avoid issues
  * use thermal mass as much as possible
    * rain barels on the north side, painted black, filled with water
    * burried ibc containers (efficiency unproven)
  * natural (thick but renewable) vs artifial (thin but poluting)

- heating with compost
