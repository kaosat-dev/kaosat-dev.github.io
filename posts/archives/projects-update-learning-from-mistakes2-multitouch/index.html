<p>I have not been able to work on my flat-multitouch screen prototype in the last few month but i intend to step it up this year : so here is a short overview of what has been done, and what is upcoming.</p>
<h1 id="the-past">The Past:</h1>
<h2 id="what-went-wrong">What went wrong:</h2>
<ul>
<li>in hindsight it might have been a better idea to start of on a smaller, cheaper and easier project: but hey, challenges make you learn more and faster!</li>
<li>the complexity of the project is really high, the amount of elements to take into account is quite huge, and the problems often intertwined: sampling speed, IC speed, power consumption (the final version is supposed to use hundreds of IR PhotoDiodes...), best layering method for Endlighten, backlighting etc</li>
<li>the costs: both time and money have been short in the last months, so see points above</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-went-right">What went right:</h2>
<ul>
<li>There actually were not as much problems as i feared, and the biggest ones i came across were actually solved in the last few weeks i worked on the project</li>
<li>i managed, in a few very small scale tests to make the Endlighten work both as IR and visible light diffuser (thus making it work as backlight as well)</li>
<li>even if it was the first LCD disassembly i had ever done, i did not damage it (nor myself) in the process.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-future">The future:</h1>
<h2 id="hardware-side">Hardware Side</h2>
<p>Before i stopped working on it , i managed to solve the main problems i had with the initial prototype (albeit on a smaller scale, since a complete rewiring would be required)</p>
<ul>
<li>i used the op amps ability to both amplify the signal AND work as a subtraction operator : so basically i have an additional photodiode that samples the ambient IR inside the &quot;box&quot; and then subtracts the difference between the value at the current sensor, and the ambient IR, before amplifying the result: this enables the next point.</li>
<li>since i can now have a sufficiently strong signal even with the LCD matrix on TOP of the endlighten, it can be used both as backlight AND IR Diffuser!</li>
<li>a big problem i have is still the costs of manufacturing the whole printed circuits and the cost of components : well &quot;costly&quot; is very relative of course, but i think i will go through one or two additional prototyping phases before i invest in a final design</li>
<li>in the meantime, since the ir diffusion/backlight/lcd matrix section is functionally separate from the IR sensors themselves, i might use a standard webcam based solution to be able to start writing some software: only problem is , i am not sure i will be able to use the same kind of  &quot;subtraction-then-amplification&quot; method i explained above , so this will require testing as well.</li>
<li>i have also started designing schematics for a &quot;two level&quot; system for the ir Photodiode density : the boards would allow for two configurations , without the need for rewiring :  in the &quot;cheaper&quot; configuration there would only be 1/2 of the photodiodes (cutting costs in half at least),  but it will be possible to double the resolution by adding more photodiodes to the same board,  when budget allows it :)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="software-side">Software side</h2>
<ul>
<li>you may have spotted, in one of the previous articles , the fact that i am currently learning Python, oh and i happen to absolutely love it ! So, as soon as i can,  i will probably write some multitouch applications using <a href="http://pymt.txzone.net/">PyMT</a></li>
<li>I am still torn on whether it will be possible to interpolate the values</li>
</ul>
<p>As a bonus : here is a small schematic explaining how the endlighten works as backlight aswell as IR diffuser:</p>
