# Long time no post: old L-System and Cellular Automata files  

Hello ye all out there !

It has been ages since i last posted ,  and there are **lots** of news comming up , but first, i will just keep it simple and straight to the point , so this article will be a "skinny" one!

- since i have been asked nicely a few times and i feel ashamed by my absolute slowness in replying , i have uploaded a few files i promised ages ago:
    - the experiments i did ages ago with **L-System** in C# (winforms)
    - some other coding experiments dealing with **cellular automata**, also in **C#**

read more and download after the break !

_**General disclaimer:**_

These files are so old and outdated , that i only zipped them up and i am providing them "**as is**" .

- they are messy, i can't even remember which sub project works or not , they are **raw source** in **semi random** folders
- they do **not** represent my coding style or quality: these are around **3 years old**, where done i a  rush, and were originally never meant to be redistributed
- all that negativity aside, you can use all this freely, should you be able to salvage anything:)

**Downloads:**

- Lindenmayer systems: (fractals) : [download](http://www.kaosat.net/uploads/old_projects/Lindemayer Systems.zip)
- Cellular automata : [download](http://www.kaosat.net/uploads/old_projects/CellularAutomata.zip)

And that is all for now folks !  Since these are old , i can't remember the details of them, but don't hesitate if you have questions !

On an unrelated note I will publish a few additional articles in the next few weeks, detailing progress on the various newer projects (and boy, has there been a lot of it this summer !!)!

Cheers!
