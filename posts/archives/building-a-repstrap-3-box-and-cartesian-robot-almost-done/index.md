# Building a repstrap (3) box and cartesian robot almost done

Things are shaping up for the YARP project ! But also stepper motor mishaps, and other problems!

"On the bright side of life":

- finished cutting and test-mounting the acrylic side and back panels
- corrected some axis alignment problems ( mainly on the vertical axis, as usual)
- the opto end- stops and associated elements are in place for the most part.
- I have also chosen the type of plastic extruder (the part that actually "prints" the plastic): I will be building and settled for a **_pinch wheel design_** as it seems to be the easiest and  usually simpler designs work best : see [here](http://blog.reprap.org/2009/01/pinch-wheel-extruder-prototype.html) for example for more information

On the less good side of things:

- Unfortunately, I also a big mishap with the vertical axis stepper motors : I didn't notice one of the threaded rods wa stuck and it seems to have **_damaged one of the steppers beyond repair_** (it emits a small vibration, but does not turn at **ALL**). To be honest I expected these to fail , as they were the least reliable and oldest ones I had, and hey you can only get so much out of 10 year old salvaged motors that had been sitting in a garage for years)
- the amount of tiny but oh so annoying adjustments is a mindbogling : its one of those days , when each time you correct a problem another one seems to pop up right away
- due to my exams and the insane heat we are having, i had to slow the construction down, also i am a bit stuck until i receive the replacement steppers
