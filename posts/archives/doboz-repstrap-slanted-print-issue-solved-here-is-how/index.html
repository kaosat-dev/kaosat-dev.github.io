  <h1 id="doboz-repstrap--solving-the-slanted-print-issue">Doboz repstrap : solving the slanted print issue</h1>
<p>I spent the last <strong>two weeks</strong> trying to find the source of the &quot;slanted&quot; printing (see pic above) and solve the problem (also, going insane in the process) , here are the steps i went through to get to the bottom of it:</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Every print, but in particular all those containing <strong>circular elements</strong> (very visible on this variant of Wade&#39;s extuder gear by NopHead) would be progressivelly offset on the x axis, and the problem was actually getting worse ! <img src="./assets/imag1215_5225689935_o.jpg" alt=""></li>
<li>Also , when looking back at one earlier print failure i had on a bigger gear, the problem might actually have already been present, since the <strong>only</strong> part that was offset on the x axis was the circular attachment at the top: <img src="./assets/imag1127_5189781538_o.jpg" alt=""></li>
<li>Giving the extreme slowness of my machine (maximum speed of <strong>2.4mm/s</strong> which is about <strong>20 times less</strong> than a Reprap, but more on that in another post) , this kind of problem is really bad, since printing takes a lot of time, and the slanting problem is only really visible and can be confirmed after around 5-10 layers .</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology:</h2>
<h3 id="1-is-it-a-mechanical-problem">1. Is it a mechanical problem?</h3>
<h4 id="a--z-axis-assembly">a- Z axis assembly:</h4>
<p><img src="./assets/imag1201_5252245485_o.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnosis</strong>: Earlier in the machine&#39;s testing phase i have had problem with the whole <strong>X/Z assembly</strong> becoming <strong>slanted</strong> , which affected the prints but certainly not in the way i was seeing now.</li>
<li><strong>Solution</strong>: i switched the Z axis threaded rods with higher quality ones and redid the motor couplings, then i checked for any alignment problems with a laser pointer (crosshair generator) attached to the assembly: <img src="./assets/imag1207_5225688847_o.jpg" alt=""></li>
<li><strong>Result</strong> : It reduced/ eliminated the slipping coupling issues of the Z axis,but the problem  <strong>remained</strong> !</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="b--x-axis-platform">b- X axis platform:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnosis</strong>: During the many stages of mechanical adjustments to the extruder attachments, and due to some original misalignment of the screws holding the roller bearings  in place, the <strong>X axis platform</strong> had gotten <strong>slightly loose</strong> (the bearings not exerting correct pressure on the sliding rails), which i had fixed temporarily with .... subway tickets ... (forcing them between the platform and the rails reduced the wobble), so i thought the problem might be comming from there. Also , there was slightly <strong>more backlash on this axis</strong> then on the Y one, so that might have accounted for the problem too.</li>
<li><strong>Solution</strong>: I disassembled the platform, re-drilled the holes for the bearing screws, improve and tightened the structure to reduce wobble and i added a <strong>second captive nut</strong> right next to the first one, to reduce the backlash.<img src="./assets/imag1204_5252854208_o.jpg" alt="">(the weird screw like things is a special positive/negative nut)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./assets/imag1206_5252246357_o.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Result</strong> :While it greatly improved the quality of each layer being printed (these adjustments were long overdue), the problem <strong>still remained</strong> !</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2is-it-a-software-problem">2.Is it a software problem?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diagnosis</strong>: The firmware i am using on the dual AtMega 328 chips running the machine is a rather heavilly modified 5D code , and since i work on a basis of &quot;only use what you understand at least a bit&quot; i have started to think that my stepper timing changes were faulty (the timing i use is nothing but a really cheap hack, without register timers...).</li>
<li>Solution: Just to be sure , i decided to try a completely different firmware , which does the timing calculations quite differently, so i used a VERY trimmed down version of the HYDRA_MMM firmware V1.4 (which is a lot easier to modify and understand than the 5d Firmware, although it does&#39;nt (yet) support separate extrusion commands)</li>
<li>Result :I spent a few hours adapting the firmware, and i made a few test prints ... the problem , as ever was <strong>still present</strong> !</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3is-it-a-power-supply-problem-">3.Is it a power supply problem ?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Diagnosis: I have had problems in the past every since i installed the new heated bed (which uses way too much power), so i wondered if it was &quot;gobbling&quot; up the power to the steppers, and causing a malfunction.</li>
<li>Solution: Just to be sure, i did a few test prints without the heated bed, to see if things were any different..</li>
<li>Result : Once again,  no change, the prints were <strong>still slanted</strong>!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-answer">THE answer!</h2>
<p>I didn&#39;t know any other thing to try, then a friend suggested simply swapping out the <strong>X-axis Pololu Stepper driver</strong> and that ...did the trick!! I was baffled, but i have been printing day and night ever since and have had <strong>NO</strong> problem at all !</p>
<p>So there you go , perhaps there was a glitch in the connection between the stepper driver and the motherboard, but either way, in case you run into this kind of weird problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>either <strong>adjust the pot of the stepper boards</strong></li>
<li>or s<strong>wap the boards</strong> out ..</li>
</ul>
