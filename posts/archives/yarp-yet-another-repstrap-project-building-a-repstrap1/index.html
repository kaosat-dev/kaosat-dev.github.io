<p><a href="./assets/wpid-IMAG0462.jpg"><img src="./assets/wpid-IMAG0462-179x300.jpg" alt="" title="wpid-IMAG0462.jpg"></a></p>
<p>In the past months I have gathered the different parts needed to build a Repstrap/low cost cnc machine, and recently I finally had time to start building the machine!</p>
<h1 id="repraprepstrap-what-is-that-again-"><strong>Reprap/Repstrap, what is that again ?</strong></h1>
<p>Of course, not everyone might know what a reprap/repstrap is :  the official site has a very good explanation <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Main_Page">here</a> , and the wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RepRap_Project">article</a> is quite complete aswell .</p>
<p>Basically its an <strong><em>open source 3d printer</em></strong> , ie, just like you can print text with a standard printer, with this type of device you can actually print (generally plastic) <strong><em>objects</em></strong>!</p>
<p>I could go on for ages about the endless possibilities of such machines , the more you know and think about them, the more you see what they are able to do , even at the relatively early stage in their development, the more amazed you&#39;ll become !</p>
<p>3d printers have actually existed for quite a while,  but they were very expensive , commercial, and closed (as in not open source), they have just become accessible for us mere mortals in the last few years, and their evolution , the different experimentation people are doing with them, are quite staggering.</p>
<p>A Rep<strong>Strap</strong> works along the same lines as a Reprap, minus the self replication, and a generally different type of structure/construction.</p>
<h1 id="why-do-you-even-need-such-a-device"><strong>Why do you even need such a device?</strong></h1>
<p>Many reasons actually !</p>
<ul>
<li>For more and more of my projects, i have been needing specific parts which are either not easily obtainable , too expensive, or simply do not exist (<a href="http://www.kaosat.net/?p=850#more-850">things</a> of my own design etc).</li>
<li>Building such a machine teaches about a lot of different fields: stepper motor control, mechanical engineering, specific programming etc</li>
<li>You might have seen me mention my interests in biology and biochemistry and bioinformatics :there has been a lot of research going on in printing replacement organic tissue or even organs! no , i kid you not : here is a video about this aspect of 3d printing : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80DhBLEhdzk">www.youtube.com/watch?v=80DhBLEhdzk</a> depending on how things go, this is definitely an area i will explore</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="what-is-this-yarp-you-are-talking-about-">What is this &quot;YARP&quot; you are talking about ?</h1>
<p>&quot;<strong>YARP</strong>&quot; is for &quot;Yet Another Repstrap Project&quot; , since well, everyone loves pirates, Simon Pegg, and there are a lot of different type of repstraps already.</p>
<p>It is actually going to be a cnc machine aswell : in the first stages, before i build/buy the plastic extruder, that will be its main function to be precise.</p>
<p>It started out with these objectives :</p>
<ul>
<li>modular design, to enable me to test different approaches to the axes (rod, belt driven, different axis configurations etc)</li>
<li>i also wanted to keep it as <strong>low-cost</strong> as i could</li>
<li>and  somewhat&quot;<strong>eco-friendly</strong>&quot; (promoting reuse of old equipment etc) although, as you&#39;ll see in a future article, reusing pieces of old hardware can make things a bit complicated and less reliable</li>
</ul>
<p>To sums things up, a little Fact sheet :</p>
<ul>
<li>The electronics are generation 1 , from a German Reprap shop ( chicken and egg problem: I had no way to create circuit boards )</li>
<li>all of the stepper motors and most of the mechanical parts are salvaged from old printers ( this imposed certain limitations of course , since I had to make do with what I had on hand )</li>
<li>Estimated costs : around 150 euros</li>
<li>Build area : W:200 x L:200 x H:80 mm</li>
<li>Construction time so far : 3 weeks</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the first post in a series, as i intend to increase the number of my articles, and this specific project was very iterative, so expect news on this front, quite often!</p>
