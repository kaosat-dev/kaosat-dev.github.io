<p>&quot;Hey Mark, what the hell is that weird looking thing again&quot; ? To put it simply, the extruder driver of a reprap /repstrap machine is the part that <em><strong>MOVES</strong></em> the <strong><em>plastic filament</em></strong> that is going to be <strong><em>melted</em></strong>, using different  methods (pinchwheels, cogs, you name it).</p>
<p>This was the part i feared the most from the beginning , since its almost the only part of the machine (with the extruder itself) that requires really specialised/more complex parts , or so i thought!</p>
<p>Here is how it actually went:</p>
<h3 id="the-good">The good:</h3>
<ul>
<li>this version you can see above was done after a bit of experimenting with all the cogs i managed to salvage from a few printers (i should call those goldmines, really)</li>
<li>in the end these were the only two &quot;compatible&quot; cogs i could use in this design, as the one mounted on the motor&#39;s axis , is the only one i could modify to ensure that the cog does not &quot;slide&quot; on the axis when a lot of force is applied to it .</li>
<li>the second cog (<strong><em>idler</em></strong>), is rotating freely thanks to two ball-bearings salvaged from my old roller-skates</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-bad">The bad:</h3>
<ul>
<li>i wanted to re-use one of the stepper motors i salvaged as well, but those clearly don&#39;t have the necessary torque unfortunately</li>
<li>while it works <em>surprising well</em> with a <strong>PLA</strong> plastic filament, for some reason, i was <strong><em>never able</em></strong> to reliably make it work with <strong>ABS</strong> (another type of plastic, think legos) , it might be because of the plastic itself , the slightly larger diameter of the <strong>ABS</strong> filament , or perhaps simply because of the shoddy construction</li>
<li>i will frankly say i don&#39;t believe this system will work reliably in the long term, so one of the <em><strong>FIRST</strong></em> things i will <strong>print</strong> on the machine as soon as it works, is simply all the replacement parts for a better extruder</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-ugly">The ugly:</h3>
<ul>
<li>while you will find proof in the video below that it is indeed possible to have a working, semi-reliable extruder driver from scrap, it can never go beyond a temporary solution</li>
<li>the whole thing is approximate at best, and not practical to mount on the machine itself</li>
<li>if i do not manage to print out replacement parts quite fast and this mechanism breaks down, i will <strong><em>really</em></strong> be in trouble , since i would really like to avoid having to shop for some additional parts again</li>
</ul>
<p>To give you a better idea of how it works here is another picture and a video:</p>
