  <h1 id="the-endless-walz-of-reprap-self-upgrades">The endless walz of reprap &quot;self&quot; upgrades</h1>
<p><a href="./assets/5844847269_05cc2c88f5_b.jpg"><img src="./assets/5844847269_05cc2c88f5_b.jpg" alt="" title="Aclara upgrades 1"></a></p>
<p>I have been keeping quite quiet since the last update on the first successful movement of my second generation Reprap machine, and that is because i have been steadily improving and upgrading various parts of it, well, of &quot;her&quot; , since she is now dubbed &quot;Aclara&quot; (in dedication to my girlfriend&#39;s support and patience  since this is a more than just a bit time consuming passion..)</p>
<p>Here is an overview of the different problems i had , and the new /re designs i came up with.</p>
<p>These will all be relased on <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a> (the fantastic open library of object designs , for those who haven&#39;t heard of it yet) once i cleaned them up :</p>
<p>(I will update the article then , with links to the objects)</p>
<p>**first update : added link to the motherboard clamp object and the printable &quot;squashed frog&quot; **</p>
<h2 id="printed-squashed-frog">Printed &quot;squashed frog&quot;:</h2>
<p>No worries, no animals were injured in the process!</p>
<p>The squashed frog is the part that is underneath the Y axis platform, and to which the belt as well as the bushings/bearings rolling on the rails are attached.</p>
<p>The initial version was cut manually from plexiglass, but due to my lack of good quality tools/workspace, while it worked , it certainly would not have won prizes for quality !</p>
<p>So i decided to design a printable version, that had to :</p>
<ul>
<li>be mechanically resistant enough</li>
<li>be relatively fast to print</li>
<li>be made of more than one part since it needed to be as big if not bigger than the maximum print size</li>
<li>have mounting point for the bushings as well as the belt clamps</li>
</ul>
<p>So here is the design i came up with:</p>
<p><img src="./assets/imag2687_5841043018_o.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>it is made of 3 parts , two of which are identical</li>
<li>it requires 4 nuts and bolts to be assembled</li>
<li>the inner holes with roundings enable the parts to be strong yet not use too much plastic</li>
<li>it is relatively fast to build and easy to assemble</li>
<li>it works well !</li>
</ul>
<p>I have yet to test it with a heated build platform but i am not too worried, because if the printed bushings of people using a hbp don&#39;t melt, then there is no reason for this to melt :)</p>

<h2 id="stronger--simpler-y-axis-motor-mount-with-additional-bearing-holder">Stronger , simpler Y axis motor mount, with additional bearing holder</h2>
<p>The motor mount iself  is actually a derivative of a design that can be found <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5514">here</a> on thingiverse.</p>
<p>I redesigned it from scratch to be parametric and modular, and to actually fit my machine :)</p>
<p><img src="./assets/imag2545_5840492931_o.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="./assets/imag2551_5841042032_o.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I also added a bearing holder on the other side, for easier, straighter belt mechanism.</p>
<p><img src="./assets/imag2707_5844867815_o.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>(this also means that my machine only uses one type of smaller bearings (for M4 bolts) )</p>
<h2 id="x-axis-motor-mount-and-idler-redesign">X axis motor mount and idler redesign</h2>
<p>Although the general shape stays the same , i redid the design from scratch in openscad as well.</p>
<p>My main beefs with the previous version of these elements were:</p>
<ul>
<li>glued on bushings not practical to mount</li>
<li>lack of stability (way too wobly, but that might have been my bushings)</li>
<li>motor mount was way too weak, and deformed very fast with the stepper motor&#39;s heat</li>
<li>smooth rod holder screws not practical</li>
</ul>
<p>So these were changed with to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a simple &quot;M6&quot; hole for the smooth rod rail</li>
<li>a shorter height</li>
<li>&quot;rounded&quot; and thickened motor mount with additional support underneath</li>
<li>side holes for smooth rod mounting screws (instead of beeing at the bottom , like in the previous design</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="./assets/imag2710_5844879493_o.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="reprap-gen7-motherboard-clamps">Reprap gen7 motherboard clamps:</h2>
<p>Once again, the previous motherboard &quot;holder&quot; was just a big piece of plexiglass, held in place by zip ties, nice, but not &quot;minimal&quot;, nor quick.</p>
<p>So i came up with these clamps, to be fited on the structure&#39;s threaded rods, that already hold well by simple tension, but which are even more stable thanks to the inwards pressure once you screw the motherboard onto them.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2 id="various-higher-quality-reprints">Various higher quality reprints:</h2>
<p>In addition to all the elements that needed designing / redesigning , i also re printed a certain number of elements that were not of good enough quality (and it helps that the new machine prints these at 15X the speed of my old &quot;Doboz&quot; machine !</p>
<p>All of the critical , or weaker elements were reprinted aswell : gears, gears gears, extruder elements etc</p>
<p><img src="./assets/imag2561_5841042578_o.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="./assets/imag2715jpg_5844896729_o.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>So this is what the machine looks like now :</p>

<p><img src="./assets/imag2704_5845397212_o.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="./assets/imag2702_5844846689_o.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>As a famous band once said &quot; and it was allll yeloww&quot; (well not ALL yellow in this case, but at this rate, all the old (black) pieces will soon be gone...)</p>
