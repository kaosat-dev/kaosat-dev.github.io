# The long sleep


It has been years since I wanted to pick up (b)logging again, since even the best of social
networks come and go (I am looking at you Google+), and the knowledge spread is more limited or gets lost.

For now I might not focus on a specific topic for each post, it will largely be dictated by
the various projects I am working on (software & hardware), and the mood of the moment.

So this is a mish mash , but with tags!
