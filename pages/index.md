Welcome !
I am a Dad, living in Germany, gardener of code & plants.

- Passion for 3d (programming, webgl, printing), at the service of 'real' things (food, health, building etc), but also for fun !
- Shamelessly enthusiastic javascripter , occasional C++, Pythonista, etc
- One of the main developpers/maintainers of https://github.com/jscad/OpenJSCAD.org and proud of it :)
- Love of plants, nature & woodworking
- Increasingly minimalist: less is more ! (less tooling, less complexity etc)


* core dev of [jscad](https://openjscad.org/)
* mentor for kids at [CoderDojo-saar](http://coderdojo-saar.de/)
* find me on [github](https://github.com/kaosat-dev)
