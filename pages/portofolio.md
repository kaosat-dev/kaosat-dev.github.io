# Why a portofolio/showcase ?

I have worked on a lot of projects in the past decade, on a lot of 3D/webgl, quite visual projects, so it recently dawned on me: let's have a nice visual showcase ! I love learning, challenges, finding the right tools for the job, as you can see in the list below.
 
## Jam / usco 

A very modular, multi platform Webgl app for collaborative editing & sharing of 3d designs for Ultimaker/Youmagine.com for 3D printing & more

***Key points:***

  * blazingly fast , streaming parsing for various 3d formats (stl, amf, 3mf)
  * mobile (UM3 app), Web, and backend (thumbnail generation using Headless webgl rendering)
  * bill of materials, shared 3d designs and a LOT more !

## OpenJscad/ Jscad

A procedural, code based 3d modeling tool, for the browser, desktop, CLI & more ! Ie: write some code, get a 3d printable design !
A project with a huge scope and possibilities

  ***Key points:***

Over the past (5+) years I was a core developer/maintainer of OpenJscad 

* Upgrade to modern Es-next, development of core features & UI of parametric 2D/3D modeling program (Javascript, Node.js)
* development of core modeling & maths features, UI
* creation of a desktop app (Electron)
* migration from monolithic code to node modules
* setup and addition of a huge amount of unit test

* I did a talk at HannoverJs a few years back that explains the scope and challenges of my work on the project

* I also created [Electron based experimental Desktop app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJyede1Ah9k&list=PLCiWVcSJ1UJSghHdQcTsAaXOBDkX0Nmx9)

- Using the principle of 'dogfooding' (actually use the software you are developing), I often used the software to create robots, pcb housings, gardening tools etc
### Variations

#### Signed distance field modeling

At some point I also experimented with purely GPU based rendering based on signed distance fields as a possible frontend/renderer alternative

#### Coffeescad

I also worked on a fork in CoffeeScript for a while called ... Coffeescad !
There is an [interview](https://www.golem.de/news/coffeescad-3d-druckmodellierung-im-browser-1305-99271.html) I did about it for the German It/tech journal Golem

## 3d printing

A long standing passion & work of mine is 3d printing, in all its aspects: software, hardware, electronics, processes

## Game engine/ tech exploration


This personal project was a breeding ground to learn/ deepen my understanding about a lot of technologies, and how far you 
can push a 'tool-less' web stack (no build steps, using native esmodules only as much as possible)
