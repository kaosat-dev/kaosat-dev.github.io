# Who again? 

![peek-a-printer](/assets/img/mememe.jpg "peek-a-printer")

I am a Dad, living in Germany, gardener of code & plants.

- Passion for 3d (programming, webgl, printing), at the service of 'real' things (food, health, building etc), but also for fun !
- Shamelessly enthusiastic javascripter , occasional C++, Pythonista, Elixir, etc
- One of the main developpers/maintainers of https://github.com/jscad/OpenJSCAD.org and proud of it :)
- Love of plants, nature & woodworking
- Increasingly minimalist: less is more ! (less tooling, less complexity etc)
- etc ?

Love people, love to talk , so please drop me a line : kaosat.dev**AT**gmail.com !
